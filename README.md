## 📌 Introduction
Movie Genre Classification is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based Machine Learning project that predicts the genre of a movie using its textual description.
This project is developed as Task 1 of the CodSoft Machine Learning Internship and demonstrates practical implementation of text classification using classical ML techniques.

---

## 📖 Overview
The system analyzes movie plot descriptions and classifies them into appropriate genres such as Action, Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Romance, etc.
The model uses TF-IDF vectorization for text feature extraction and Logistic Regression for multi-class classification.
A Streamlit web interface is provided for real-time prediction.

## 🧠 What is Movie Genre Classification Using NLP & Machine Learning?
Movie Genre Classification is a text classification problem where machine learning models are trained to identify patterns in movie descriptions.
Using NLP techniques, textual data is converted into numerical vectors, which are then used by ML algorithms to predict the most suitable genre for a given movie plot
